# Advanced Regression House Pricing Assignment
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

> The company wants to know:

    - Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

    - How well those variables describe the price of a house.

> Business Goal
    The model with the price of houses with the available independent variables need to be developed. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- This project is build to predict the Sale Price of House pricing based on different features. In this we performed Advanced Regression Analysis to predict the features that play a significant role in increasing the Sale Price of the House.
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- We are helping the business to understand the factors on which the Sale Price for the House depends. Specifically, the factors affecting the Sale Price for the Houses in the Austrilan market using Advanced Regression Analysis with help of Ridge and Lasso Regression Analysis.
- Dataset: Housing dataset details with different features like 'KitchenQuality','GarageType','Basement','LotArea' and etc;.
